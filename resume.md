## Professional Summary

Architect and systems thinker with deep experience designing structures that preserve coherence under pressure. Creator of PortusSophia™, a governance-first architectural framework integrating symmetry principles, drift detection, and boundary modeling. Strong ability to stabilize ambiguous systems, translate complex problems into testable architecture, and guide organizations through high-risk, high-friction decision environments.

Skilled at bridging human reality, engineering, and governance into a single structural language.

## Selected Architecture Work

### CoSymmetric Quantum-Aligned Architecture (CQAA)

A symmetry-based architecture that maintains stability between technical, human, and governance layers. Created to handle high-risk, ambiguous environments where coherence must be preserved across domains.

### Architectural Symmetry Standard (ASS)

A formal standard ensuring reciprocal evaluability: any system that evaluates humans must be equally evaluable itself. Enforces fairness, structural integrity, and transparent governance.

### PortusSophia™ Multi-Site Ecosystem

Designed a four-site, boundary-enforced topology separating public orientation, research, governance, and professional identity. Ensures clarity, prevents drift, and aligns content with audience intent.

### Governance Workflow & Witness Model

Designed a role-separated stewardship system with witness cycles, drift detection, and structural audit layers to maintain architectural honesty across evolving systems.

### WebKernel Directory Architecture

Built a layered content framework separating Canon, Interpretive Layer, and Public Orientation with strict topology rules and trademark controls.

## Professional Experience

### AI Researcher — JennAI-Inception

**Remote | 2020–2025 (Intermittent Research Work)**

- Conducted foundational AI research exploring interpretive alignment, drift, memory, and structural symmetry.
- Developed precursor concepts that later informed PortusSophia™ governance and architectural standards.
- Self-directed research emphasizing awareness modeling, structural risk, and human–machine interaction constraints.

### Founder / Architect — PortusSophia™

**Baltimore, MD | 09/2025–11/2025**

- Conceived and formalized the PortusSophia™ governance-first architecture during a compressed 60-day innovation window.
- Authored CQAA (CoSymmetric Quantum-Aligned Architecture) and ASS (Architectural Symmetry Standard).
- Designed multi-site ecosystem (public, academic, governance, founder).
- Implemented role-separated stewardship, witness cycles, and drift-detection workflows.
- Built topological, governance, and repository structures supporting the architecture.
- Developed the WebKernel and interpretive layer boundaries.

### Technical & Operational Roles (Various)

**2000–2020**

- Led teams and systems in structurally demanding environments.
- Designed and maintained operational frameworks with high reliability requirements.
- Identified and corrected structural weaknesses in workflows and processes.

### United States Army — Early Career

- Developed resilience, discipline, and execution clarity under tension.
- Learned structural thinking in real-world, high-stakes conditions.
